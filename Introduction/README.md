- Browser takes HTML and create `DOM`.
- JS helps us modify DOM based on user actions or events.
- In big applications, working with DOM becomes complicated.

#### Problems With JavaScript
- React has a simpler mental model.
- JS is cumbersome(Time-Taking).
- JS is Error-prone.

#### Working of React
- No need to worry about querying and updating DOM.
- React creates a web page with small and reusable components. 
- React will take care of creating and updating DOM elements.
- It saves a lot of time.

#### JS Vs React
- JS is Imperative: You define to reach your desire state.
- React is Declarative: You define the target UI state and then react figures out how to reach that state.

#### Components
- `Components` helps us write reusable,modular and better organize code.
- React application is a tree of components with `App` component as the root bringing everything together.
